        A Career Objective or a Resume Objective is essentially a heading
        statement that describes your professional goals <br />in two to three
        sentences. Employers looking to hire an employee for a position tend
        <br />to seek candidates that <br />are driven enough to understand what
        they want.

        An internship is a period of work experience offered by an organization
        for a limited period of time.[1] Once confined to medical graduates,<br />
        internship is used practice for a wide range of placements in
        businesses, non-profit organizations and government agencies. They are
        typically undertaken by students<br />
        and graduates looking to gain relevant <br />skills and experience in a
        particular field. Employers benefit from these <br />placements because
        they often recruit employees from their best interns, who have known
        capabilities, thus saving time <br />and money in the long run.
        Internships are usually arranged by third-party organizations that
        recruit interns on behalf of industry groups.
